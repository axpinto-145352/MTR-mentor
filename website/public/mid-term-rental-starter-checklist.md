*15 points covering everything from property assessment to your first tenant.*

---

## 1. Property Assessment

- [ ] **Evaluate proximity to demand drivers**
  Hospitals (traveling nurses), corporate campuses, universities, military bases, and insurance-dense areas. Properties within 15 minutes of a major hospital are the highest-demand MTR locations.

- [ ] **Check local regulations for 30+ day rentals**
  In most markets, stays of 30 days or more are exempt from short-term rental (STR) permits and occupancy taxes. Verify with your municipality — most treat MTRs the same as traditional rentals.

- [ ] **Assess property condition and layout**
  2–3 bedroom units perform best. The property should be in good condition with reliable HVAC, plumbing, and appliances. Mid-term tenants expect a higher standard than long-term renters.

---

## 2. Furnishing Essentials

- [ ] **Budget $3,000–$8,000 per bedroom (all-in)**
  Includes furniture, linens, kitchenware, décor, and supplies. A 2BR property typically costs $6,000–$16,000 to furnish depending on market positioning.

- [ ] **Prioritize the Big Three: mattress, sofa, WiFi**
  Invest $400–$800 in a quality mattress, $500–$1,000 in a comfortable sofa, and ensure reliable high-speed internet (100+ Mbps). These three items drive reviews and renewals.

- [ ] **Complete the kitchen — fully**
  Dishes for 4–6, pots and pans, knife set, cutting board, coffee maker (non-negotiable), toaster, dish towels, oven mitts, and basic cleaning supplies. A poorly stocked kitchen is the #1 tenant complaint.

- [ ] **Add a work-from-home setup**
  A desk, ergonomic chair, and good lighting. Most mid-term tenants work remotely at least part-time. This is now an expected amenity, not a bonus.

## 3. Listing & Marketing

- [ ] **List on Furnished Finder (primary platform)**
  Furnished Finder is the #1 platform for traveling nurse and healthcare housing. One-time annual fee, no per-booking commission. Highest-intent tenant pool for MTRs near hospitals.

- [ ] **Cross-list on Zillow and one additional platform**
  Zillow gets massive traffic for 30+ day rentals (free to list). Add Airbnb monthly stays, Facebook housing groups, or corporate housing platforms (CHBO, Landing) based on your target tenant.

- [ ] **Professional photos — minimum 15–20 images**
  Bright, well-composed photos of every room. Include exterior, kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, workspace, and any unique features. Professional photography pays for itself in faster bookings.

- [ ] **Write a listing that sells benefits, not features**
  Lead with tenant benefits: "Walk to Memorial Hospital in 5 minutes" beats "Close to hospital." Include monthly pricing, utilities policy, lease flexibility, pet policy, and parking details.

---

## 4. Tenant Screening

- [ ] **Verify employment or assignment documentation**
  Request a signed staffing agency contract, corporate relocation letter, or insurance claim authorization. This confirms the tenant has a defined reason and payment source.

- [ ] **Run background and eviction checks**
  Use a screening service that returns results in 24–48 hours. Check for eviction history and criminal background. Most traveling nurses and corporate tenants pass easily.

- [ ] **Collect first month's rent + security deposit before key handover**
  Standard security deposit is equal to one month's rent. Require renter's insurance ($15–$30/month for tenants). Document property condition with timestamped photos at move-in.

---

## 5. Pricing & Legal

- [ ] **Price using the 2x–3x rule**
  Your MTR rate should be 2x to 3x your area's unfurnished long-term rental rate. A $1,200/month unfurnished property should target $2,400–$3,600/month as a furnished MTR. Validate against Furnished Finder comps in your market.

- [ ] **Use a written lease with MTR-specific terms**
  Include: lease term and renewal options, monthly rent and deposit amounts, utilities responsibility, house rules, early termination clause, and guest policy. A standard long-term lease template needs MTR-specific modifications.
